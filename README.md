# Kalman 2D demo
## Kalman Filter implementation

### [Live demo](https://avivace.github.io/kalman)

Final project for the *Probabilistic Models for decision making* course, from my MSc.

### Deploy

```bash
git clone
npm install
npm run serve
```

Deploy to `avivace.github.io/kalman`:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

> Development is done on the `develop` branch due to GitHub's restriction on branches for user pages (the build is deployed on the `master` branch and deployed to `avivace.github.io/kalman` from there).
